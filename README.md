# UniversalHistoryVerified
This is the verified version of the Spigot plugin, Universal History. You can get this by applying on our discord server.

Note to the people who think that they can become verified just by compiling this plugin:
In order for your "add" command to be processed by the server, your servers' ip has to be manually added to a list of verified servers. This means that no, you can't mess up the database by being cheeky.
